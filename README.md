# FIFA Players Data Project
Hey everyone,  
This project is all about diving into a huge dataset of FIFA players. It’s full of detailed stats about players from all around the world stuff like pace, shooting, passing, and more.  

I spent some time exploring the data, cleaning it up a little, and trying to find cool patterns and insights. Like, who’s the fastest player? Who’s got the best overall rating? Which countries are producing the top talent?  

It's just a fun, casual project to practice data analysis and visualization skills. Nothing too crazy, just playing around with the numbers and seeing what stories they tell.  

If you want to see the full walkthrough and all the steps, feel free to check out the original Kaggle notebook here: [FIFA Project Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mo7amedmomo/fifa-project).

Hope you enjoy going through it!
